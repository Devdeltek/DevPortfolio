## Design Ideas

My main focus was to create a website where I can showcase my projects and make detailed write ups about the creation process. I wanted to keep the writing and publishing process super simple so there is as little friction as possible between me coming up with an idea and getting it uploaded. I decided early on I was going to use Markdown for the actual writing experience as I am already an avid [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) user and I've fallen in love with the format. Lucky for me the [Tailwind CSS Blog](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/building-the-tailwind-blog) has a write up on how they made their own blog with very similar goals to mine. It was very helpful in pointing me in the right direction.

## How it's made

I made this portfolio site using the following technologies:
 - [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
 - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
 - [Pigment CSS](https://github.com/mui/pigment-css)
 - [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

It was my first time using NextJS, Pigment CSS and MDX. Overall development went smoothly, NextJS and MDX work together nicely
