# Next JS Portfolio site

## How it's made

I made this portfolio site using the following technologies:
 - Next JS
 - Pigment CSS
 - MDX

## Design Ideas

My main focus was to create a site where I can write out my though process for my projects to detail my learning process. I wanted to make the writing process as easy as possible, so a large focus was intigrating the markdown format and automatically importing the articles, so all I have to do is make a new file and type some stuff out, then recompile the website to have it all updated.
