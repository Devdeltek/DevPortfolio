# Test1

- Be specific about the projects the applicant would be working on after they started
- Be clear that we are a small team, so everyone has to do a bit of everything, including customer support
- Give concrete examples of projects we just finished that the applicant would have worked on if they were already at the company
- Go into detail about specific hard problems we expect to run into on the next major upcoming project, to help the applicant understand the sort of expertise that would be valuable to us
- Share concrete salary and benefit information. I would never apply for a job without a clear understanding of the salary, so why should I expect talented people to apply for our posting without it?
