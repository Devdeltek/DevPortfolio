			<h1> Hello, I'm Devin! </h1>
			<p>I'm an enthusiastic Software Engineer living in California. I'm passionate about learning and enjoy exploring topics such as web development, graphics programming and statistics. In my free time I love running, playing TTRPGs, and music. I made this website to showcase some of my personal projects and jot down my thought process when tackling new projects.</p>
